<ul>
  <li>Welcome to the experiment. During the experiment, you will be experiencing different trips in public transport (of the type you will see in the next page). The <b>virtual transportation network</b> shown in the experiment was <b>designed to mimic what you might experience while traveling through _city_’s public transport</b>. <b>The trips will all be on a bus</b> and you will be travelling from one location to another. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes you will be waiting at a bus stop or travelling on a bus, just like in real life. During the trips, you will wait on average between 4 and 5 seconds and never more than one minute. In this context, please <b>imagine that 1 second in the experiment corresponds to 1 minute of waiting or travelling in real life.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>We want you to experience these trips as if you were travelling in public transport. To see an example of a trip, please click<b> _buttonNextSimulationExperimentDescriptionPage_</b></li>
