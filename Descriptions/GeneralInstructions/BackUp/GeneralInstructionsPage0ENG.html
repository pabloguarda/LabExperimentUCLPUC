<p><b>CAREFULLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>
<p>Welcome to the experiment. You will be experiencing different trips in public transport (of the type you will see in the next page). The virtual trips are designed to mimic what you might experience in the real life while traveling through _city_ ’s public transport. The trips will all be on a bus and you will be travelling from one destination to another. </p>
<p>Sometimes you will be waiting at a bus stop or travelling on a bus, just like in real life. During the experiment, you will wait on average between 4 and 5 seconds and never more than one minute. Please imagine that 1 second in the experiment corresponds to 1 minute of waiting or travelling in real life. </p>
<p>We want you to experience these trips as if you were travelling in public transport in real life. To see an example of a trip, please click _button_<br>
