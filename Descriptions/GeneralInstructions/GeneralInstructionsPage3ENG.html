<p>During the experiment you will see <b>_totalChoiceSets_ route choice scenarios</b>. Each scenario presents two bus routes and has _nStages_ stages:</p>
<p><b>Stage 1: Learning: </b>You will learn about the two bus routes (<b>Blue and Red Routes</b>). To achieve this goal, you will experience some trips in each route (<b>as you did in the example</b>). The order of the bus trips in each route will be random. For example, the first trip might correspond to the red route (or blue route). The next trips might correspond to any of the two routes.</p>
<p><b>Stage 2: Decision: </b>After finishing <b>Stage 1</b>, you will have experienced the same number of trips in each bus route. Based on this experience, in <b>Stage 2</b> you will be asked for your preferred bus route. </p>
<p><b>Stage 3: Consequences</b>. You will experience some trips in the bus route chosen in <b>Stage 2</b>. These trips will be a consequence of your previous choice.</p>
<p><b>Stage 4: Confirmation</b>. You will be asked about how certain you are on your choice made in <b>Stage 2</b>. You must consider your experience in <b>Stage 3</b>.</p>
<p><b>After completing the _nStages_ stages, you will begin with a new route choice scenario. </b></p>
